# ChernobyLight

"Chernobylight" is a funny parody where a group of clumsy nuclear plant workers accidentally create chaos instead of preventing a disaster. With silly mistakes and ridiculous solutions, the movie reminds us of the importance of being responsible and capable, even in funny situations.
